The idea of "green growth" - producing more while polluting less - has become embedded within environmental strategies such as SDG 8, the Paris Agreement, and the European Green Deal. However, the notion of economic growth completely decoupled from nature is baseless and distracting. To achieve truly sustainable economic growth, production and consumption must be absolutely decoupled from all environmental pressures at a fast pace and maintained over time.The author challenges the notion of green growth, arguing that there is no evidence it can be achieved and that reducing GDP is necessary to reduce emissions and ecological footprint. They cite small reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in European countries as evidence that green growth is not feasible and argue that growth undermines sustainability efforts. They suggest that reducing emissions by 55 percent by 2030 would require significant GDP degrowth and that ignoring the ecological impact of consumption makes the problem even worse.The text discusses the idea of "d-growth" or a steady-state economy as a realistic strategy for reducing environmental pressure and achieving environmental targets in Europe. The concept involves downsizing production and consumption to prevent ecological overshoot and eventually fluctuating around a steady-state economy that does not exceed planetary boundaries or compromise living standards. The ultimate goal is to decouple GDP from carbon and achieve a high quality of life and low ecological footprint. High-income countries must reduce their consumption to create space for less privileged countries to grow sustainably and meet their needs. This strategy aims to ensure well-being for all within planetary boundaries.The text suggests that the story of "coupling" is dangerous because it reassures people that everything is fine and can lead to complacency. The idea of "green growth" is seen as a form of macroeconomic greenwashing that is preventing necessary radical change. The writer argues that we are losing precious time by tinkering with the system and not focusing on the urgent need for transformation. The text poses the question of whether we should prioritize economic growth or preserving nature.
