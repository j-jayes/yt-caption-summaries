Artificial intelligence will assist in decision-making, providing recommendations and bases, but ultimately leaving the final decision to a human being in professions such as those dealing with life and death. The labor market is changing due to digitization and AI implementation, and the podcast guests discuss the future of the labor market and the skills that will be in demand with AI. Magnus Lodefalk and Erik Engberg work in the field of economics and research the impact of technology and globalization on companies and employees' lives. They focus on artificial intelligence and its effects on the labor market and predict that AI will become a natural part of a workplace. It will assist with tasks and be integrated into the software and computer-based environments.The development of AI technology will have both positive and negative effects on the economy and labor market. While it can increase productivity and improve overall welfare, there may also be problems for certain groups and industries depending on how it is used. AI is considered a general purpose technology that can be applied in various industries and will have a broad effect on the economy. Initially, the IT industry will lead in AI development, but eventually, other industries will also utilize the technology. AI will become a "colleague" that may go unnoticed but will change the content of work.The speaker believes that AI will have a significant impact on knowledge-intensive service professions and service sectors, though it may have less effect on certain industries such as mining, agriculture, and the hotel business. AI will be useful as an aid in industries like legal and financial services, HR, and finance departments, but the degree to which it takes over tasks may depend on the profession and job. Repetitive tasks like sending payment reminders and compiling data may be automated using service robots or algorithms, though more research is needed to determine the extent of AI's impact.In larger companies, computer systems can replace people who have few and repetitive tasks, leading to decreased demand for this type of competence and lower salaries. However, professions that require multifaceted and complex tasks are more difficult for AI to handle, so AI can assist instead of replace humans. This can increase productivity and job satisfaction, leading to increased demand for these types of competencies and higher wages. In professions where life-and-death decisions are involved, AI may only provide recommendations and decision-making bases instead of making the final decisions.When it comes to big, life-changing decisions, humans are still needed more than AI. The human touch, personal relationships, and local knowledge and networks are difficult for AI to replace. However, AI can be beneficial in areas such as work productivity and globalization through tools like real-time translation.The text discusses how technology can facilitate competition in the labor market from other countries, which can be positive for some individuals, but negative for others who are out-competed by those with lower living costs. It also mentions how AI can be helpful in solving simple tasks, but can add stress for those in customer service who handle the complicated cases. The author suggests that new technology may lead to more stressful jobs, but also to the emergence of new professions and industries that we cannot predict.The speaker believes that jobs in the agricultural industry will not run out in the long term, but acknowledges that changes in technology may lead to tough changes for some individuals, at least in the short term. However, new professions are emerging, and national economists generally agree that jobs will not disappear altogether. Those in professions that can be more easily automated may need to retrain or seek education in a different field.The text mentions the impact of AI on the job market and suggests that AI skills will be highly in demand in the future. Those who know AI technology will have good job opportunities and high salaries. To stay competitive, it is important to have good knowledge in the field and continuously update oneself. The text also notes that there are debates around how quickly new professions and jobs are emerging, and how quickly jobs are disappearing.thstand the test of global competition, while others require constant updating and local knowledge to remain valuable. STEM professions will be in high demand in the future. AI can bring about increased wages and standard of living in the long-term, but jobs that can be done remotely or through automation may not see the same wage growth in the short term.The text discusses the potential impact of technology on the job market, particularly in regards to the polarization of wages between different education levels. It suggests that certain professions requiring cognitive abilities may become less attractive as technology becomes increasingly capable of doing the work. The importance of lifelong learning and adapting to changes in the labor market is emphasized, and it is suggested that education may need to be designed to enable this. Online courses and platforms like Coursera are seen as important tools for this, as they provide accessible education at a low cost.The article discusses the benefits of online lectures from top lecturers, as well as the importance of incorporating practical elements to put knowledge into practice and create networks. It suggests that Sweden is well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities in AI due to its successful IT companies but emphasizes the need for effort to promote AI and create the right training. The article mentions an increase in job advertisements demanding AI competence over the past 5-6 years and suggests that even basic understanding of AI can be useful.The text discusses the benefits of investing in AI technology and becoming an AI specialist in various industries. It emphasizes the importance of having a strong foundation in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. The author also discusses how the field of national economics has shifted towards data science and machine learning, with many national economists working for companies such as Google and Facebook. The text suggests that AI is a rapidly developing field that is becoming increasingly essential to many industries.The text discusses the increasing use of AI in our daily lives and the potential ethical concerns that come with it. The speaker suggests that we are in the early stages of AI development, but it will become more noticeable over the next 10 to 20 years. They also emphasize the importance of using AI in an ethical way, particularly in areas such as recruitment where AI algorithms may exacerbate discrimination. However, the speaker notes that their research does not focus on the ethical aspect of AI.The importance of developing algorithms that can be explained to avoid unequal job opportunities is emphasized. Regulation is needed to ensure responsible use of AI in areas such as transportation, but overregulation can hinder technology development. The speed of AI development poses challenges for society to keep up with potential misuse, such as creating realistic fake videos and bots. Appropriate regulation may eventually be necessary to address these risks.Exciting opportunities and risks with AI development, which requires studying its effects on different groups. Preliminary findings suggest new professions related to AI are positively associated with university education in natural sciences and technology, but negatively related to being a woman and located in rural areas. It is crucial to prevent negative impacts and lessen gaps between groups in technology education and awareness. The current focus in this field is researching the impact of AI on society.The text highlights the importance of having detailed data on the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on different groups of people and companies. Without this data, we may miss out on positive changes or encounter problems. To ensure human flourishing, we need better knowledge about the use and effects of AI. Sweden has an advantage in this regard due to its fine register data with information on the entire population and all companies. The text concludes by thanking Erik and Magnus for sharing their knowledge and wishing them luck with their research projects.
